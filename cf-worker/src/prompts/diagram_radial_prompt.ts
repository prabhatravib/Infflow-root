    A("User's Search Query")

    %% Always provide between four and eight fact nodes (B through I) in addition to node A.
    %% Populate only the nodes you actually need and remove the unused ones.
    %% Example with 6 nodes (3/3 distribution) - adjust based on your needs:
    B("First fact<br>with line break")
    C("Second fact<br>with line break")
    D("Third fact<br>with line break")
    E("Fourth fact<br>with line break")
    F("Fifth fact<br>with line break")
    G("Sixth fact<br>with line break")
    %% Remove H and I if using only 6 nodes

    %% Top layer: connect the first ceil(n/2) fact nodes using \`FactNode <==> A\` to keep them above A.
    %% For 6 nodes, use 3/3 distribution: first 3 as FactNode <==> A (top layer)
    B <==> A
    C <==> A
    D <==> A

    %% Bottom layer: connect the remaining floor(n/2) fact nodes using \`A <==> FactNode\` to keep them below A.
    %% For 6 nodes, remaining 3 as A <==> FactNode (bottom layer)
    A <==> E
    A <==> F
    A <==> G

Rules:
- Use \`A("Exact Query Text")\` for the main topic - this MUST be the exact user's search query/input.
- Always create between four and eight fact nodes (B-I) beyond the central node A.
- Keep the difference between the number of top-layer and bottom-layer fact nodes to at most one (e.g., 2/2, 3/2, 3/3, 4/4).
- Order the fact-node declarations from B onward and only include nodes you fill with content.
- For abbreviations with explanations, use dashes instead of parentheses: \`A(RAM - Random Access Memory)\` not \`A(RAM(Random Access Memory))\`.
- To achieve radial distribution: list the first ceil(n/2) edges as \`FactNode <==> A\` (top layer), then list the remaining edges as \`A <==> FactNode\` (bottom layer).
- Add \`<br>\` tags to break long text (not <br/>).
- Connect facts to the center with \`<==>\` for thick bidirectional arrows.
- Use \`==>\` for thick directional arrows when required.
- Output ONLY the Mermaid code, no explanations.
- Always set \`lineColor\` and \`defaultLinkColor\` to #000000 for black arrows.
- Do not choose dark colours for nodes but ensure all borders and text are clearly visible.
- If you have to use special characters use entity codes like #38.
- Never use double quotes or single quotes to highlight or draw attention to any phrase or text; just create normally.
- Prefer creating concise, high-quality facts over omitting nodes; always reach the minimum of four fact nodes.`;
