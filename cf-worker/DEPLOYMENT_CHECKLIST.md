## ðŸ“‹ Deployment Steps

### 1. Build Frontend
```bash
cd cf-worker/frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

### 2. Set Up Secrets
```bash
cd cf-worker
wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY
# Enter your OpenAI API key when prompted
```

### 3. Deploy Worker
```bash
wrangler publish
```

### 4. Verify Deployment
- [ ] Visit the deployed URL
- [ ] Test the search functionality
- [ ] Verify diagram generation works
- [ ] Check dark mode toggle
- [ ] Test deep dive feature

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results

After deployment, you should see:
- âœ… "Answers, you can See!" branding prominently displayed
- âœ… Sophisticated UI with Header, Sidebar, Tabs, and Filters
- âœ… Working search with suggested queries: "Details about Paris", "Pepsi vs Coke", "Steps to bake a cake"
- âœ… Real-time diagram generation
- âœ… Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- âœ… Dark mode functionality

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Files

### wrangler.toml
- Main entry point: `src/entry.ts`
- Assets directory: `../Infflow-magicpath/dist`
- OpenAI model: `gpt-4.1`

### .wranglerignore
- Excludes `../Infflow-magicpath/` and `../pitext_desktop/`
- Excludes development files and test files

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check that the frontend was built successfully
2. Verify the assets directory path in wrangler.toml
3. Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY secret is set
4. Check Cloudflare dashboard for error logs

## ðŸ“Š Performance Expectations

- Cold start: < 100ms
- Diagram generation: 2-5 seconds
- UI responsiveness: < 50ms
- Global edge deployment for low latency
