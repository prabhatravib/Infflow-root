GPT-4.1 basics for text input. Use the Responses API for new builds. It supports streaming, function calling, and Structured Outputs, and it is the target for most new platform features. GPT-4.1 offers a very large context window, listed as 1M tokens on the model page. If raw speed and cost matter more than peak capability, GPT-4.1 mini is the faster, cheaper sibling you can route to for easy turns. ([OpenAI Platform][1])

What actually moves latency on GPT-4.1
• Enable streaming. Set stream to true so tokens start arriving sooner. This improves time-to-first-token and perceived latency. ([OpenAI Platform][2])
• Cap the output. Set max_output_tokens as low as you safely can. Fewer generated tokens means less decoding time. This is called out directly in OpenAI’s latency and production guides. Add stop sequences to end generations as soon as your protocol is satisfied. ([OpenAI Platform][3])
• Pick the right service tier. Use service_tier "priority" on latency-critical endpoints to reduce queue time during busy periods. Leave it unset or use default for standard behavior. ([OpenAI][4])
• Keep tool use parallel. When you use tools, keep parallel_tool_calls true so the model can request multiple function calls in one turn instead of serial round-trips. This is supported on 4.1 and reduces back-and-forth delays. ([OpenAI Community][5])
• Use prompt caching where you can. If you reuse a stable system preamble or RAG header, pass a prompt_cache_key to improve cache hits. Cached input is billed at a lower rate and can be processed faster. ([OpenAI Platform][6])
• Structured outputs only when needed. Structured Outputs enforce a JSON schema. Use them when you require strict JSON. If you do not need validation, skip it to avoid extra work. Measure in your app. ([OpenAI Platform][7])
• Trim the request itself. Latency improves when you send fewer input tokens and make fewer requests. Route simpler prompts to a smaller model when possible. ([OpenAI Platform][3])

Windows-friendly code examples

Python, Responses API, streaming, tight token cap, priority tier, cache key, and an early stop:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

stream = client.responses.stream(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "Answer concisely in 2-3 sentences."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain how vector databases index embeddings."}
    ],
    stream=True,
    max_output_tokens=120,
    stop=["\n\n"],                 # end as soon as a blank line appears
    service_tier="priority",       # faster processing path when available
    prompt_cache_key="infflow:sys:v1"
)

for event in stream:
    if event.type == "response.output_text.delta":
        print(event.delta, end="")
```

Streaming plus a low max_output_tokens drives the biggest practical win for perceived and absolute latency. Priority tier helps during peak load. ([OpenAI Platform][2])

Node.js with tools, parallel calls, and a firm token cap:

```js
import OpenAI from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI();

const response = await openai.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-4.1",
  stream: true,
  input: [
    { role: "system", content: "Return one tight JSON object." },
    { role: "user", content: "Get NYC weather then suggest one indoor activity." }
  ],
  tools: [
    {
      type: "function",
      name: "getWeather",
      description: "Get current weather",
      parameters: { type: "object", properties: { city: { type: "string" } }, required: ["city"] }
    },
    {
      type: "function",
      name: "planActivity",
      description: "Plan an indoor activity",
      parameters: { type: "object", properties: { weather: { type: "string" } }, required: ["weather"] }
    }
  ],
  parallel_tool_calls: true,
  max_output_tokens: 160,
  stop: ["\n\n"],
  service_tier: "priority",
  prompt_cache_key: "infflow:sys:v1"
});
// handle the streamed Server-Sent Events...
```

Parallel tool calls cut round-trips when the model needs more than one function. Keep the output cap tight and stream the result. ([OpenAI Community][5])

Practical defaults for a fast text-only stack
• Responses API with stream true by default. ([OpenAI Platform][2])
• max_output_tokens set per route to the minimum that still meets product requirements, plus a stop sequence. ([OpenAI Platform][3])
• service_tier "priority" on user-visible interactions that must feel snappy. ([OpenAI][4])
• prompt_cache_key on flows with a stable prompt header. ([OpenAI Platform][6])
• Route easy prompts to gpt-4.1 mini and reserve gpt-4.1 for harder turns. ([OpenAI Platform][8])

Notes on costs and limits that affect speed indirectly. The pricing page lists separate rates for cached input vs standard input and for output tokens. If you are consistently hitting throughput ceilings, raising your capacity or shifting more traffic to cached input will reduce contention and cost per request. ([OpenAI][9])

If you want a quick local check on your machine, you can time three configurations side by side: streaming on vs off, max_output_tokens 128 vs 512, and service_tier default vs priority. The pattern you are looking for is lower time-to-first-token with streaming, lower total wall-time with a smaller token cap and an early stop, and lower tail latency with priority during busy periods. ([OpenAI Platform][2])

Where to look in the docs later
Streaming responses, latency best practices, Structured Outputs, service tiers, and prompt caching all have short, focused pages and are worth skimming before you lock in your defaults. ([OpenAI Platform][2])
